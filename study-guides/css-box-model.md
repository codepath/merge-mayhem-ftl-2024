# CSS Box Model

- Property: A property is the type of style on an HTML element. This includes color, positioning, font, border, etc. Check out MDN Docs for a full list of CSS properties.
- Value: This is the exact style you want to implement on your website. In the example above, we want to use the color `navy` in the `body` of our website.
- **Note:** Each property has its own set of valid values. For example, The `color` property can take values by name (`blue`, `green`, etc), Hex format (`#FFFFFF`), or RGB colors (`rgb(255,255,255)`).
- `:`: The colon symbol is used to separate the property and value.
- `;`: The semicolon symbol is used to end a declaration or rule.

There are many great reference materials to read about different CSS properties and values. We highly recommend checking out [CSS Reference's free visual guide to CSS](https://cssreference.io/).
