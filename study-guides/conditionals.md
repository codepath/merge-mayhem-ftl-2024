# Conditionals
4. The keyword `else`.
5. Another set of curly braces, inside which we have some more code — this can be any code we like, and it only runs if the condition is not `true` — or in other words, the condition is `false`.

In summary, conditional statements allow us to create a decision-making process in our programs, where different actions can be taken depending on whether a condition is true or false.
