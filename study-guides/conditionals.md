# Conditionals
We make decisions everyday from what to eat, what to do first when we wake up, etc. In order to do this we often ask ourselves simple yes or no questions to make decisions. In order to help computers make decisions, we use **conditional statements** to tell the computer what to do at various points in our program.

**Conditional statements** are programming commands that are used to handle decisions and control program flow. We use the keywords `if` and `else` to define a conditional statement in JavaScript. Conditional statements in JavaScript follow a similar syntax as conditional statements in Java.
